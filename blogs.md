As companion material to the release of our (proto-)book on Geometric Deep Learning, we have curated a series of blog posts. These blogs present a "digest" version of the key ideas covered by our work, as well as insight into how these ideas developed historically. We thank [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) for kindly hosting these blogs. Thoughts, comments and any kind of feedback are all very welcome!
