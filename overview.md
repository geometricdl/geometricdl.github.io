As part of the [African Master's in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI 2021), we have delivered a course on Geometric Deep Learing (**GDL100**), which closely follows the contents of our GDL proto-book. We make all materials and artefacts from this course publicly available, as companion material for our proto-book, as well as a way to dive deeper into some of the contents for future iterations of the book.
