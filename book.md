"**Symmetry**, as wide or as narrow as you may define its meaning, is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection."---Hermann Weyl, _Symmetry_

"I have discovered such wonderful things that I was **amazed**...out of nothing I have created a strange new universe."---JÃ¡nos Bolyai, in a letter to his father

The Geometric Deep Learning textbook is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of geometric deep learning. 
As we prepare for releasing our book with MIT Press, we will make individual draft chapters of the book available here. 
We are expecting a cadence of roughly 2--3 weeks per individual chapter release. Once published here, the chapters will remain online, for free.

In addition, we have leveraged the material from the GDL Textbook to support Master's level courses at both [Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2023-2024/geodl/timetable.html) and [Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2324/L65/).
Wherever relevant, we will also use this page to share lecture slides corresponding to individual chapters.
